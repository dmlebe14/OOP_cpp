# OOP_cpp

The rest of the codes (not including "The Witcher") written by me on C++ during the Object-Oriented Programming class on my 3rd year of the Bachelor's degree at the RUDN University (Moscow, Russia).

1) matrix_delete_rowcols.cpp file shows the process of deletion of chosen by a user row and column of a matrix using the OOP.
2) matrix_choose_rowcols.cpp allows to choose an element with the specific row and column using the OOP.
3) circle.cpp allows to create a circle manually writing its parameters: radius, centre, colour etc., - using the OOP.
